Regarding the task given by the E-cell web team

Sorry for the inconvenience I have problems regarding my github which I take too much time to resolve that's why I have not made another css file 
I won't repeat from next time.


This project consists of :-
1)This page 1 having two files--> Frontpage.html & FrontPage.js  

* These files have the first FIGMA project
* The html file has the css and html both

2) This page has the following :-
   *The Portfolio Front Page
   *The Js file and the Html file
   *Some Images including icons which are used in the project
